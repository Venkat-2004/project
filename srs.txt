## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The Student Result Management Tool (SRMT) is a software system designed to streamline the process of managing student records, recording results, and providing necessary information to students and faculty members in an educational institution.

### 1.2 Scope
This document outlines the software requirements for the SRMT. It defines the features, functions, and constraints of the system to ensure a common understanding among stakeholders.

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
- **SRMT**: Student Result Management Tool
- **UI**: User Interface

### 1.4 References

### 1.5 Overview
This document presents a detailed description of the SRMT, including its purpose, scope, and specific requirements.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
The SRMT is a standalone system that interacts with users through a web-based user interface. It may integrate with existing student information systems and databases for data synchronization.

### 2.2 Product Functions
The SRMT will provide the following core functions:
- User registration and authentication
- Student profile management
- Course management
- Result entry and calculation
- Result publication
- Reporting
- Notifications

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
The primary users of the SRMT include administrators, faculty members, and students. Administrators manage the system, faculty members record results, and students access their results and profiles.

### 2.4 Operating Environment
The SRMT will run on modern web browsers and require an internet connection. It will be hosted on a secure server with backup and data recovery mechanisms in place.

### 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints
- The system must comply with data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR).
- The system should be scalable to handle a growing number of users and data.

### 2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies
The SRMT assumes:
- Users have basic computer literacy.
- Reliable internet access is available for all users.
- Integration with existing systems will be feasible.

## 3. Specific Requirements

#### 3.2.5 Result Entry
- Faculty members can record student results for specific courses.
- Results include student ID, course code, and grade.

#### 3.2.6 Result Calculation
- The system calculates GPA and other relevant metrics.
- It supports different grading systems (e.g., letter grades, percentages).

#### 3.2.7 Result Publication
- Results are published at the end of each term.
- Students can view their results online.

#### 3.2.8 Reporting
- Administrators can generate various reports, including grade distribution and student performance reports.

#### 3.2.9 Notifications
- The system sends notifications to users regarding important events (e.g., result publication).

### 3.3 Non-Functional Requirements

#### 3.3.1 Performance
- The system should respond to user requests within 2 seconds.
- It should handle concurrent users without performance degradation.

#### 3.3.2 Security
